# Catalyst UI Refinements - Summary Jan 26, 2026

## 📱 Responsive & Mobile Refinements
- **Navbar Layout (Tablet/Mobile):**
    - **Overflow Fix:** Applied `min-w-[60vw] max-w-fit` to the desktop container to prevent clipping while allowing natural expansion.
    - **Tenant Name:** Implemented smart truncation (`max-w-[140px]` + `truncate`) to prevent the user menu from breaking the layout on medium screens.
- **Navbar Layout (Desktop):**
    - **Split Distribution:** Refactored to a **Left (Logo/Tenant) / Center (Nav) / Right (Actions)** layout for better balance.
    - **Centered Navigation:** Navigation links are now absolutely positioned in the exact center of the bar.
- **Action Center:**
    - **Mobile/Tablet Layout:** Centered the panel (`95vw` width) for better visibility.
    - **Optimized Navigation:** Switched to **Icon-Only Tabs** on mobile/tablet to save horizontal space.
- **Mobile Apps Menu:**
    - **Active State:** Applied **Solid Brand Background** (`bg-primary`) to the active item in Light Mode for clearer indication.
- **Global UI:**
    - **Scrollbars:** Implemented `.scrollbar-minimal` (Zinc-300/700) and `.scrollbar-none` utilities for a cleaner aesthetic.
